<h1>Manual tester portfolio</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>
I am interested in the IT industry and in this direction I would like to develop.
Currently I am trying to gain practical experience on the uTest platform,
mainly performing functional tests of mobile and web applications. I have fully
completed the uTest Academy and I am constantly expanding my knowledge
by participating in courses on learning platforms such as Udemy and LinkedIn
Learning. I am a meticulous and conscientious person, I approach tasks
entrusted to me in a challenging manner and I find myself well working in a
team. Besides testing, I also ran a small coffee shop and graduated from the School of Banking with a degree in Business Management.
